# BouncingBallClass

In this project you will write a program using [Processing](https://processing.org) that displays five bouncing balls. You must create a Ball class and create five instances of the class. You may add additional functionality (color, line color, tracing, bouncing of each other, etc). 

When you are happy with the appearance of your project, you will post your finished program on a website. You can get a free [GitHub](https://github.com) account for your website. Instructions on how to put your program on a GitHub website are on slides [GitHub Instructions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ixFGgkEH7pFzWNaX8LePapQFWQg0BbsdVZMflQqHeSU/edit?usp=sharing). Submit the link to your website on google classroom.
